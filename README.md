## Description
_Ender Bench_ is a small Minecraft mod for Fabric that adds a new block to the game.
This block has 15 slots of inventory and hopper can add and remove items from it.

When the closest player is within 32 blocks of the _Ender Bench_ and tries to open its inventory while sneaking, it will instead open the _Ender Bench_.

When the _Ender Bench_ is powered by redstone, it will no longer search for the closest player but will instead lock the currently closest player, allow that player only to access it, if it is in range. Other players in range will not be able to access it remotely.

The _Ender Bench_ is crafted like:\
