## Description
_Ender Bench_ is a small Minecraft mod for Fabric that adds a new block to the game.
This block has 15 slots of inventory and hopper can add and remove items from it.

When a player is within 32 (changable via config inside the jar) blocks of the _Ender Bench_ and tries to open its inventory while sneaking, it will instead open the _Ender Bench_.

When the _Ender Bench_ is powered by redstone, it will find the current closest player, lock onto them, allowing only that player to access it, if it is in range. Other players in range will not be able to access it remotely. So if you have someone inbetween you and the enderbench while you power it, it will lock onto the other player.

The _Ender Bench_ is crafted like:\
